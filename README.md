# Checklist generator

Allllllrighty. This is a supremely custom project which may prove useful for Biodiversity Galiano and Biodiversity
Squamish, but hopefully for a broader audience once it's complete. 

It's a tool that converts a CSV file into a checklist of rows, grouped by hierarchy. I'll explain it in much greater 
detail later, plus get a demo running on github pages (it has an entirely front-end working app).

It's just a quick project (by "quick", I mean just a few days) - it's already generating the data in HTML format, but needs to be a lot
more flexible in both the output (HTML, plain text) and in the manner by which you can use it. Being a front-end 
dev I've slapped a UI onto it that allows you to upload the CSV via the browser and generate the desired checklist, 
but I'd like to make it run separately as a node script so people can regenerate the data programmatically, just 
by saving a file.
